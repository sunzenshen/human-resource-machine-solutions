Human Resource Machine Solutions
--------------------------------
My solutions for the stealth assembly programming game
[Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine).

The files with the .txt extension can be copied and then pasted into a running instance of the game.

Some solutions include my notes from playing with [Compiler Explorer](https://gcc.godbolt.org/) by Matt Godbolt.  The method of converting Compiler Explorer output into Human Resource Machine solutions is documented in my blog post ["GCC Driven Design for the Human Resource Machine"](https://sunzenshen.github.io/play/2017/01/08/gcc-outsourcing-machine.html).

Copyright reserved but frankly not enforced.
As with any of these kinds of games,
you get out what you put into it, though there's no shame in getting a little help now and then.
Feel free to use as you like, just not in production! :)

Enjoy!
